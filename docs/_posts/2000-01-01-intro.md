**Graffiti** is a simple [spring-boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) based web app for generating diagrams from source passed as query string, so that it's easy to embed in your markdown or static site documentation.

Supported syntax types:
- [PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net)
- [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language))

Supported output types:
- SVG
- PNG

Inspired by [gravizo](http://gravizo.com/), which offers a lot more but requires you to send potentially confidential information to a 3rd party.
With graffiti it's up to you where you run/deploy it and the applied level of security.
